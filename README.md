# Contextual Comments

Have you ever read a math textbook and spent half an hour trying to
understand one paragraph? Usually everyone else is stuck on the same
part. Leverage the crowd's knowledge with contextual comments.

What are contextual comments? You can see an example of them in [The Django
Book](http://www.djangobook.com/en/1.0/chapter01/). To be clear, this is
completely unrelated to Django; I just wanted to reproduce/steal the awesome
commenting system that djangobook.com uses.

The meat of the contextual commenting system is in
commentable.js. Unfortunately, it is not completely separated from this GAE
app. One of these days I plan to do that, but if you'd like to take a shot
at it go ahead. I would love to see the results.
